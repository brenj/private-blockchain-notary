=================================

About
-----

From Udacity:
> Data stored on a blockchain can vary from digital assets (e.g. documents, media) to copyrights and patent ownership. These pieces of data need to be reliably secured, and we require a way to prove they exist â€” this is where signing and validation are key. In this project you will build a private blockchain notary service to validate and provide proof of existence for your favorite star in the universe.
